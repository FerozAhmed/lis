# LIS

A simple interface to medical laboratory instruments. It implments a rough subset of ASTM E1394-97 (or, possibly CLSI LIS02-A2)

It listens for test requests and results and forwards them via HTTP.  It is intended to interface with the [worklist_manager](http://github.com/levinalex/worklist_manager) web application.
